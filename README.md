Purrito provides a way to manage and care for cats in a boarding facility.  

When caring for cats in a boarding facility it can be difficult to keep track of what the requirements of each cat are.

Typically, Check-in and Check-out dates are managed through an appointment or calendar type booking system, but the individual care requirements for each cat are usually handwritten and kept on clipboards or a whiteboard for each cat.  
Perhaps you need to prepare meals for 40 different cats who all require different food!  You either need to write a list, or bring the clipboards to the kitchen with you to keep track of who needs what.

The **purpose** of Purrito is to provide a quick overview of which cats are currently in boarding and what their requirements are for both morning and evening mealtimes. It will reduce time wasted preparing lists or clipboards for boarding cats and work towards a paperless facility.

The **target audience** is animal attendants caring for cats in a boarding facility.  
However, the app could easily be adapted to care for other animals, or expanded to other audiences - to manage vehicles that require servicing, children attending daycare, etc.


Navigation within Purrito needs to be simple to suit the audience.  
The user will either nagivate the menu with up and down arrows and return, or will be prompted with the kind of information required. eg. 'Enter name', or 'Enter ID'. 

When the application is started, the user will be presented with a main menu of options. 
An animal attendant will use the application to check-in a cat as they arrive in boarding and provide care instructions for that cat. 

During morning or evening meals, the attendant will select the menu option for showing meals and select the time of day. 
A quick list will be generated for all cats currently checked in to boarding with each of their meals, requirements such as medications, and a flag if the cat is aggressive (their spicy rating).
