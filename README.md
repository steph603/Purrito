#### Software Development Plan

My application, Purrito provides a way to manage and care for cats in a boarding facility.  

When caring for cats in a boarding facility it can be difficult to keep track of what each of the cats requirements are.  
Check-in and Check-out dates are managed through an appointment or calendar type booking system, but the individual care requirements for each cat are usually handwritten and kept on clipboards for each cat.  
Perhaps you need to prepare meals for 40 different cats who all require different food!  You either need to write a list, or bring the clipboards to the kitchen with you to keep track of who needs what.

The aim of Purrito is to provide a quick overview of which cats are currently in boarding and what their requirements are for both morning and evening mealtimes. It will reduce time wasted preparing lists or clipboards for boarding cats and reduce paper waste.

The target audience is animal attendants caring for cats in a boarding facility.  However, the app could easily be adapted to care for other animals, or even to keep track of hotel guest preferences, etc.

Navigation within the app should be simple - numbered menus will reduce frustration with typing commands, however, the  app should also be sensitive to intuitive key words such as 'quit'. 

When the application is started, the user will be presented with a main menu of numbered options
An animal attendant will use the application to check-in a cat as they arrive in boarding and provide care instructions for that cat. 

During morning or evening meals, the attendant will select the menu option for showing meals and select the time of day. 
A quick list will be generated for all cats currently checked in to boarding with each of their meals, requirements such as medications, and a flag if the cat is aggressive (their spicy rating).
